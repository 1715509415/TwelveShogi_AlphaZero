This project is based on these main resources:

1) DeepMind's Oct 19th publication: [Mastering the Game of Go without Human Knowledge](https://www.nature.com/articles/nature24270.epdf?author_access_token=VJXbVjaSHxFoctQQ4p2k4tRgN0jAjWel9jnR3ZoTv0PVW4gB86EEpGqTRDtpIz-2rmo8-KG06gqVobU5NSCFeHILHcVFUeMsbvwS-lxjqQGg98faovwjxeTUgZAUMnRQ).
2) The <b>great</b> Gomoku development of the DeepMind ideas that @junxiaosong did in his repo: https://github.com/junxiaosong/AlphaZero_Gomoku
3) The <b>wonderful</b> Chess development of the DeepMind ideas that @Zeta36 did in his repo:
https://github.com/Zeta36/chess-alpha-zero/
4) The <b>brilliant</b> Reversi development of the DeepMind ideas that @mokemokechicken did in his repo: https://github.com/mokemokechicken/reversi-alpha-zero
5) DeepMind just released a new version of AlphaGo Zero (named now AlphaZero) where they master chess from scratch:
